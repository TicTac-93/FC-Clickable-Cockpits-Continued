Notes on the original mod's behavior:

- DCS will search for and run entry.lua if it can find it.  This should initialize the mod.  In this case, it:
	- Declares the plugin
	- Sets up a menu entry for it with options for planes depending on whether or not you own them
	- Mounts a few mod directories, including "Cockpit/Scripts" which will be checked (I think?) every time a cockpit is loaded

- mainpanel_init.lua has a "shape_name" variable that sets the cockpit model.  This seems to be how we're loading our clickable models on top of the regular cockpits.
	- This is also creating a bunch of "Gauge" objects, which I assume were for monitoring animated parts of the cockpit for xforming our interaction points.  But they seem unused.

- I think the entire utils.lua file is copied from the A-4E mod, and according to the DCS log is failing to load.... How much of this stuff is just leftover from development?
	- Would be good to try and put together an MVP build of this mod, figure out what the actual bare necessities are.

- I think that any visible cockpit animation is the result of the default game models, but that should be confirmed.  The A-10A for instance has a TON of unused switch animations at the moment.

- New plan: Start rebuilding the mod directory from scratch, one aircraft at a time.  Should leave us with the bare necessities and a better understanding of how this is all set up.

Misc notes:
- lshift + r to reload current mission in-game, this will reload any .lua scripts that get run dynamically (but won't re-init the whole plugin)
